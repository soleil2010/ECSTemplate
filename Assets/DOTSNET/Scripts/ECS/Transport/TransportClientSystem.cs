    // we need a guaranteed update order to avoid race conditions where it might
    // randomly be updated before other systems, causing all kinds of unexpected
    // effects. determinism is always a good idea!
    //
    // Note: we update AFTER everything else, not before. This way systems like
    //       NetworkClientSystem can apply configurations in OnStartRunning, and
    //       Transport OnStartRunning is called afterwards, not before. Other-
    //       wise the OnData etc. events wouldn't be hooked up.
    //
    // * [UpdateAfter(NetworkClientSystem)] won't work because in some cases
    //   like Pong, we inherit from NetworkClientSystem and the UpdateAfter tag
    //   won't find the inheriting class. see also:
    //   https://forum.unity.com/threads/updateafter-abstractsystemtype-wont-update-after-inheritingsystemtype-abstractsystemtype.915170/
    // * [UpdateInGroup(ApplyPhysicsGroup), OrderLast=true] would be fine, but
    //   it doesn't actually update last for some reason. could be our custom
    //   Bootstrap, or a Unity bug.
