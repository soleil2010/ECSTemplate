// DOTSNET is server authoritative, meaning that server syncs state to the
// client.
//
// Some components might have a client authoritative option where the client
// syncs state to the server, and the server trusts it. This can be useful for
// prototyping, movement, etc.
//
// Let's have an enum that we can reuse.
